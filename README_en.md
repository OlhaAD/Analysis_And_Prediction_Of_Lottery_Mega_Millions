# Analysis and Prediction of Lottery Number Frequencies Using Machine Learning Models

## Goals and Objectives

### Goals
The main goal of this research project is to analyze historical lottery data to predict the frequency of number appearances in future using advanced machine learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project aims to provide a comprehensive comparison between traditional trend analysis and deep learning-based predictions.

### Objectives
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Collect and preprocess historical lottery data focusing on the frequency of number appearances over time.
   - Transform the data into formats suitable for analysis and machine learning model training.

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Visualize historical distributions of number appearance frequencies to identify trends and patterns.
   - Create various charts and heatmaps for effective data representation.

3. **Trend Analysis**
   - Conduct trend analysis to identify significant numbers based on historical data.
   - Calculate slopes, intercepts, and p-values for each lottery number to determine their statistical significance.

4. **LSTM Model Development**
   - Develop and train LSTM models to predict future frequencies of number appearances.
   - Optimize the model using various hyperparameters, such as the look-back period, to enhance prediction accuracy.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the performance of the LSTM model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Compare the performance of the LSTM model with traditional trend analysis.

6. **Prediction and Comparison**
   - Predict the frequency of number appearances for future years using the trained LSTM model.
   - Compare the LSTM model predictions with trend analysis results to identify similarities and differences.

7. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - Document the methodology, results, and conclusions in a detailed report.
   - Provide visualizations and detailed explanations of the analysis and predictions.
